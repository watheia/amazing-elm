      Developing applications on a large enterprise team is different than
      creating alone or on a small team. While small groups might be able to get
      away with ad hoc decisions on application structure or coding best
      practices, the same cannot be said when you’re working with dozens or
      perhaps hundreds of other people. In addition, enterprise teams need to
      assume that their code will stick around for many years to come. That
      means they’ll need to do as much work as possible at the beginning of an
      application’s development to minimize maintenance costs down the road.


      We can summarize these concerns as follows:


      *   **Consistency** — how do we make sure everyone in the organization
      follows the same best practices for structuring and writing code?


      *   **Safety** — how do we ensure that our code will not be subject to
      attacks or prone to errors?


      *   **Increased size and complexity** — how can we structure our code so
      that it can grow without sacrificing clarity or performance?


      *   **Changing requirements** — how can we keep up with the demands of the
      business to continually update the application without letting technical
      debt get out of control?


      While small teams and small organizations share these same concerns to
      some extent, the risks can be catastrophic at the enterprise scale.
